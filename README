CobNag - Cobbler-maintained system's Nagios configuration file generator

Copyright 2009 LÃ©on Keijser <keijser@stone-it.com>


Description:
============
Cobnag can generate Nagios configuration files for a system by
making an XMLRPC connection to a Cobbler server, read what profile
is attached to it and matches services (defined in a seperate
configuration file) to it.


Configuration:
==============
A sample set of service commands and profiles can be found in /etc/cobnag.conf


Usage:
======
$ cobnag -y system_name -k customer_name

Eg.:

$ cobnag -y web01.example.com -k ExampleCorp

Will generate:

- /etc/nagios/objects/customers/ExampleCorp/web01.example.com.cfg
- /etc/nagios/objects/customers/ExampleCorp/hostgroup.cfg
